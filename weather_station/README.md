## Weather station setup

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Activating the virtual environment

> [!WARNING]
>
> Make sure the steps in [RPi Setup](../README.md) were followed before
> proceeding. Verify by checking that
> `~/RPi-project/weather_station/venv` exists.

1.  In the terminal, navigate to the project directory and activate the
    virtual environment:

    ``` bash
    cd ~/RPi-project/weather_station
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  Now, you should be able to execute the python scripts accordingly:

    ``` bash
    python3 weather.py
    python3 DHT22_cal.py
    python3 weatherplot.py
    ```

As with the spectrometer scripts, ensure that the virtual environment is
activated before running any scripts – this is indicated by `(venv)`
appearing at the start of the prompt. Note that the spectrometer and
weather station projects each have their **own separate virtual
environments**. If a script fails unexpectedly, it could be that you may
have the wrong virtual environment active (they are named the same). In
that case, run `deactivate` and repeat from step 1.

There are 3 scripts for use.

- *weather.py* is the main data collection script.

- *DHT_cal.py* helps you find the mean absolute difference between the
  actual and recorded temperature/humidity. You can then append this
  values to *weather.py*.

- *weatherploy.py* takes the output of *weather.py* and outputs a simple
  line plot.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Execute weather.py on boot

If you wish to execute the *weather.py* script on boot, instructions
below allow adding of the python execution to the boot sequence.

1.  Create a shell script named *launcher.sh* in /home/pi/Desktop/:

    ``` bash
    cd ~/Desktop
    nano launcher.sh
    ```

2.  Copy the following into the *launcher.sh* text file:

    ``` bash
    #!/bin/sh
    cd /home/pi/RPI-project/weather_station
    sudo python3 weather.py
    ```

3.  Create a log folder for crontab logging via terminal:

    ``` bash
    cd ~
    mkdir logs
    ```

4.  Access crontab (with `sudo crontab -e`) and append the following to
    the end of the crontab script. Use /bin/nano as the editor if
    prompted:

    ``` bash
    @reboot sh /home/pi/Desktop/launcher.sh >/home/pi/logs/cronlog 2>&1
    ```

5.  Exit by pressing ‘Ctrl-X’ \> ‘y’ \> enter.

6.  Reboot your RPi and the script will run in the background:

    ``` bash
    sudo reboot
    ```

NOTE:

- Your RPi will reboot, and you can still use the RPi as per usual as
  the python script is running in the background.

- To check any error occured, simply check the log file by inputting
  `cat ~/logs/cronlog` into the terminal. Otherwise, *Finaltest.csv*
  contains your data collection in
  /home/pi/RPi-projects/weather_station/,

- Adjust the schedule function calls to acquire readings in an
  appropriate interval.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Always run `deactivate` in the terminal once you’re done with the
> scripts, to make sure the venv is deactivated.
